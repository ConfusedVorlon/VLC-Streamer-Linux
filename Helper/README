===========================================
VLCStreamerClient for Linux

Author: Jens Stockhausen

Developed on Kubuntu 10.10 with Qt 4.7
Works on (K)Ubuntu 10.10 32bit/64bit
===========================================
Prerequistes:

You need some libraries and command line tools to get the application running.
On Linux you rather get these additional tools from your package management
system (dep on Ubuntu) than distributing them with your application. So please
find below the steps that you should execute in a bash.

Qt
  default Qt distribution (should be already on your system)
  install with:
    "sudo apt-get install libqt4-core libqt4-gui libqt4-network libqt4-dbus libqt4-xml"


Advertising
  commandline tool avahi-publish-service
  install with:
    "sudo apt-get install avahi-utils"


Encoding
  VLC 1.2.x (currently only on git repository and not released)
  found in a Private Package Archive (PPA) on
  https://launchpad.net/~videolan/+archive/master-daily.
  install with:
    To get the PPA into your /etc/apt/sources.list including the PGP key
    "sudo apt-get install python-software-properties"
    "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:videolan/master-daily"
    "sudo apt-get update"
    finally install or reinstall vlc
    "sudo apt-get install vlc" or
    "sudo apt-get upgrade" if vlc is already installed

   You probably also need some additional codecs for encoding.
   After adding
   "deb http://packages.medibuntu.org/ maverick free non-free"
   to your /etc/apt/sources.list
   and instaling the PGP key with
   "wget -q http://packages.medibuntu.org/medibuntu-key.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -"
   "sudo apt-get install w64codecs non-free-codecs" will install the most common codecs.

    Before you start steaming to your iPhone make sure that vlc can play the file locally.


===========================================
For now the application is using the following folders:

SITE_ROOT    :  ~/.Hobbyist_Software/VLC_Streamer/Root
...home...   :  ~/Videos
...drives... :  /media


===========================================
Things not yet implemented:

 - parsing command line for parameters

 - http digest auth for access
 - information caching of SITE_ROOT folder

 - stop process if target folder get's deleted
 - check for correct avahi version
